# Application of Predictive Analytics on Building Energy Rating (BER), Credit Defaulters, and Car Accident
This project was written in R using R Studio. The current files are my first attempt at predictive analytics using R (hence the 'not so good' code). I keep these codes to remind me of how I started and how far I've grown.

A few details about the project; it was a part of my Master's module, Data Mining & Machine Learning 1, where I was tasked with applying 5 machine learning algorithms on 3 "large" datasets. I chose datasets on Building Energy Rating (BER), Credit card defaulters and US Car Accidents.

Preliminary visualisations and EDA was carried out on each of the dataset following data preprocessing and data transformation. 

Finally, 2 machine learning algorithms were used in predicting BER and credit defaulters dataset each, and 1 machine learning algorithm was applied to the Car Accident dataset.
